This scheme library was made for scsh (http://scsh.net)

The meaning is to include systems from Object-Oriented systems, such as
classes into scsh scheme. The main candidates for this are the Standard
Template Library from C++, Java Utility classes and things from Smalltalk.

Examples are : streams and arrays from smalltalk, stringtokenizer from Java
and iterators, functors from C++ (STL.)

There is also a focus to extend the above and the system and the scsh scheme
language with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and adaptive systems. Both use
supervised and unsupervised methods from machine learning. Note that
on current machines (the year 2020) there is room for slowing down languages,
in this case scsh scheme, with these methods whereas this might be unfeasible
for a common end user programmer during his runtime. 
The techniques wanting to be used are Markov strategies, Artificial Neural
Networks and Theorem Provers, Prolog/Progol, among other things. Note that
the scheme language (a LISP dialect) is a AI programming language.

This system library was made with Actors to provide for a real OOP experrience.
